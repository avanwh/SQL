# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#First I created a sample table to visualize the data and see what data was included. 
SELECT *
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
LIMIT 20
;

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 
# 1. What is the average danceability by artist? By track? 

SELECT AVG(danceability), artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
;

SELECT AVG(danceability), track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
; 

SELECT AVG(danceability), artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 
GROUP BY artist_name
;

# 2. Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity? 

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10
;

# 3. What artist released the longest song? 

SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
;

# 4. What's the average danceability for the top 10 most popular songs? 

SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY danceability desc 
LIMIT 10
;


# 5. How many songs have a tempo above 140? What songs are they? 

SELECT COUNT(track_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo >= 140
;

SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE tempo >= 140
;


# 6. What songs have both a danceability above 0.5 and a tempo above 150? 

SELECT track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE danceability >= 0.5
AND tempo >= 150 
;

# 7. Which artists have the top average popularity? Label them as Top Stars. 
WITH popularity_average_CTE AS (
SELECT s.artist_name, 
AVG(s.popularity) AS average_popularity
FROM SpotifyData s 
GROUP BY s.artist_name
)
SELECT artist_name, average_popularity, 'Top Star' AS tag 
FROM popularity_average_CTE
WHERE average_popularity >= 90
